I analyzed a dataset of coffee sales to uncover some interesting insights:
📅 Date and Time: Explored sales trends over time. 
💳 Payment Type: Categorized by cash and card payments. 
☕ Coffee Name: Found out the most preferred coffee is Americano with Milk! 🥇
I preprocessed the data by: 🔄 Removing unnecessary columns. 🔢 Converting categorical data to numerical data for better analysis.
For visualization, I used Seaborn to create insightful charts and graphs. 📈🎨
To predict coffee prices, I developed a machine learning model using the Decision Tree Algorithm 🌳. The model can determine the price of coffee based on entered values.
Finally, I evaluated the model's performance using the Cross Validation method to ensure its accuracy and reliability. ✅📉
I'm thrilled with the results and can't wait to apply these insights in real-world scenarios! 🌟
